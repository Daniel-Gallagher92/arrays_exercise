## Arrays Self- Eval

- I feel pretty confident in my understanding of arrays and using methods.
- I do not feel like I necessarily NEED to learn more to understand the concept.
- I want to learn all of the cool methods....
- However, I could get lost for a week or more learning about every obscure method that works with Ruby arrays.

### Questions
- What are some more common examples of ways we use arrays other than users, players online, or something like that?
- What are some obscure examples that we may not know we when we would use an array?
